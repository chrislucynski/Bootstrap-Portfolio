                <p>I live in Holladay, UT with my wife, Rachel, and our "fur baby," Cooper. My wife and I started dating
                    in
                    high school when our parents were stationed in Germany - my dad was in the Army, and her mom worked
                    as a
                    civilian for the Air Force.
                    We then attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa together where we discovered our love for the
                    islands.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, paradise comes with a price, so our careers brought us out to Utah where we've lived
                    for
                    the past 5 1/2 years, which is tied for the second-longest I've ever lived in one place
                    consecutively.
                    The beautiful landscape and scenery in Utah just took our breath away so we knew we had to set up
                    roots
                    here.</p>
                <p>I'm currently working as a Nurse Manager for 5 West, the Inpatient Medical-Psychiatry unit at the
                    University of Utah. We care for those individuals suffering from
                    psychiatric issues (schizophrenia, psychosis, substance abuse/dependency/overdose, mood disorders)
                    whom
                    also have medical issues (wounds, diabetes, seizures, and organ disfunction).
                    It is a very challenging job, but it can also be vastly rewarding to help others in their time of
                    need.
                    I have some veeeery interesting stories, so if you're interested in hearing them, come find and ask
                    me!
